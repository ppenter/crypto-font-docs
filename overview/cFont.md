# What is cFont?

cFont is NFT staking platform that provide eBTC as a reward. The main idea of cFont is to create onchain limited asset on Ethereum Virtual Machine. cFont provide 3 main part in ecosystem which are explained below.

First is NFT staking, We choose NFT stking instead of the old fashion way of staking. Token staking can esily pump and dump because user that hold most reward will earn more than other user. Thus, NFT staking will generate NFT randomly and distributed reward from NFT rarity one by one. This will providee fun to hold and mint and mainly the random chance to get reward.

Second is reward token, The rewand from cFont NFT stiking is eBTC which can use in cFont ecosystem. eBTC is limited asset of total 10 millions token and cannot be created more.

And the last is Fee, this part cFont will collect fees from evry platform of cFont. In example, fees from cFont launchpad, cFontswap, cFont marketplace and metaverse things. this will make cFont become like a decentralize cooperation which every one can contribute with the platform, develop and token governance.

These are three main parts that drive the cFont ecosystem. we focus on becoming a most decentralize platform and user will earn from fee which are real profit notonly from reward pool.
